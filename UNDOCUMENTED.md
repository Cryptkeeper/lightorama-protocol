128 (`0x80` channel ID base) + 129 (channel) = 257 - 1 (index offset) = 256

256 = `0x100` = `[0x01, 0x00]`

`0x51` appears to denote the usage of a `0x01` (On) command in a multi channel usage (currently only `0x30` and `0x10` are documented, but since they only support up to 16 bits, this likely means `0x50` denotes a higher bit count.)

Each `Off` command does not appear to contain channel IDs, instead a value of `0xc7` or `0xc8`. Additionally, if the usage of `0x51` is believed to be a multi channel command usage of `0x01`, then we should not be seeing these commands turn the channels off, and instead maintain their _on_ state.

## All Off
`0x00 0x01 0x41 0x00 0x00`
Used to turn off all 8 channels in an 8 channel configuration.

## All On?
`0x00 0x0 0x31 0xff 0x00 0x00`
Used to turn on all 8 channels in an 8 channel configuration.
